## Project development


✔ Mobile-first workflow
✔ [Fully valid code](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmebl-shop.vercel.app%2F)
✔ HTML Semantic Tags

The project uses **React** and **React DOM** to create components and control the visual display:

- JSX;
- Props;
- Functional Component;
- List, Key;
- React DevTools.

Used the **Redux Toolkit** (RTK) to manage the state of the application:

- React Redux;
- Redux-Thunk;
- Redux DevTools.

CSS & SCSS was used for styling, specifically modular CSS-in-React.

**React Router** has been used for routing.

Data comes from API to generate page, retrieve products, search.

###  The project has implemented:

- Catalogue;
- Favourites page (user can add a favourite product to favourites page);
- Product cards with image gallery implemented on Swiper JS;
- Cart;
- Search by goods;
- Pagination;
- Sending the order to the server.

**Vite** is a tool for rapid development and building projects. I used it in this project to launch and build the application.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
